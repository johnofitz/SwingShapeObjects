As mentioned in code comments i have calculated the center points for the Quadrilateral
by using the centroid method as giving the Quadrilateral arbituary center points would 
involve altering the outerpoints vice versa.

The Quadrilateral that accepts a Rectangle as a parameters 
has center points directly input as the width and height are not dependant on it.
